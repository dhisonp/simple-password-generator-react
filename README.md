# Simple Password Generator
Just a simple, random password generator with customizable format; written in React.js.

### What's this project for?
Just a quick, 2-hour project to test out the development process on my new Macbook Pro 14" and experimenting with the Material UI toolkit. This is my first Mac after a lifelong chain of Windows PC, so I'll need some warm up before I code bigger time.
However, I found this app pretty useful for those who want a little bit more security in their passwords while maintaining flexibility. This is by no means a new or unique concept of an app, but it is 100% usable and reliable.

### What can it do?
Just a simple password generator with several basic options, which includes 8-16 character count slider and options to include upper cases, symbols and/or numbers. More feature might be added in time.

### How do I install?
At the moment you can only access this app by cloning in this repo and run it on your own machine. Simply clone it, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and do `npm start`.
